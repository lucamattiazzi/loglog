# Loglog

Name of this project is still temporary, it's due to the fact that is a log that shows past days with a logarithmic width.

It's a logger to keep track of food and sleep schedules of my daughter, all wrapped in a small webapp.

Other than that, you can choose your own icon if you decide to install it as a PWA on your smartphone/computer.

That's it. I'll probably add screenshots in the future.

(also, will allow users to sync data using I guess some google service, and export/import the schedule as json)
